= DataMapper MongoDB Adapter

{<img src="http://travis-ci.org/mbj/dm-mongo-adapter.png?branch=master" />}[http://travis-ci.org/mbj/dm-mongo-adapter]

== Status

This adapter is compatible to currents dm-core master. It is mostly stable and 
needs testing! We target a 1.0.beta release with 
dm-1.3.0. This adapter is not complete when it comes to mongodb feature set. 
But it is complete in sense of DM-1.3.

With DM-2.0 around the corner (https://github.com/datamapper/dm-core/wiki/roadmap)
we'll spend our development effort to implement the following mongo specific 
features in a DM-2.0 version of this adapter:

* Update operators (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Updating). 
* Atomic updates   (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Atomic+Operations).
* Embedded Value   (Virtus support this).

Contributors are most welcome! In case of any questions you can find me on 
#datamapper IRC channel.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
